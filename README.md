# Executive Intelligence

## About the Project

The Executive Intelligence is a demo of Perplexity Sonar powered application designed to provide executives and board members with instant, accurate, and credible intelligence for strategic decision-making. Recognizing the challenges of sifting through vast amounts of information quickly and reliably, this project focuses on delivering board-ready insights derived from real-time data sources, powered by Perplexity's Sonar API.

The inspiration was to create a dedicated "boardroom copilot" that streamlines competitive analysis, scenario planning, and benchmarking, while also maintaining a persistent memory of key intelligence, directly addressing the needs of busy executives.

## Features

The current version of the Executive Intelligence includes the following key features:

*   **A. Competitive Intelligence Briefs:** Generate comprehensive, board-ready competitive analysis for any company. Provides executive summaries, recent competitor moves, market shifts, recommendations, and full, verifiable citations for every claim.
*   **B. Scenario Planning (‚ÄúWhat If?‚Äù Analysis):** Dynamically generate and analyze potential future scenarios based on real-time competitor and industry data. Get structured, cited reports exploring risks, opportunities, and recommendations for hypothetical situations.
*   **C. Board Pack Memory:** Save and organize key intelligence briefs, scenario analyses, and benchmark reports. Create a persistent, searchable knowledge base accessible in a dedicated Board Pack section.
*   **D. Instant Benchmarking & Peer Comparison:** Quickly generate source-cited, visual comparisons of your company against top competitors across critical metrics. Data points are linked to their sources, providing reliable support for strategic discussions.
